Once you build your workbook, you have to upload it onto the server in the wordpress directory
which will server your workbook to the users.

wordpress data folder with learning material: /var/lib/docker/volumes/wordpress_wordpress_data/_data/learning/

We can't directly upload to the learning materials folder since we don't have permissions to directly upload files onto the server.

Therefore, we first upload the files to the server in a common directory: ~/wordpress/learning/
Run: scp -r ./builds/session1/ projectvm01.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk:~/wordpress/learning/

Zipping files before sending them is a good idea.

Now on login to the server and copy the build folder at ~/wordpress/learning/session1/ to the wordpress_data folder:
sudo cp -r ~/wordpress/learning/session1/ /var/lib/docker/volumes/wordpress_wordpress_data/_data/learning/
